Minimal WebXR stereoscopic video player (Mono/SBS/OU) for Pico 4 and other VR headsets, with adjustable screen distance, size, and alignment controls.

This project is a lightweight WebXR PWA that plays 2D and 3D movies (Mono, Side-by-Side, Over-Under) directly inside a VR headset browser such as Pico Browser. It fixes the common “tiny, far-away screen” issue by letting you adjust distance, width, tilt, and eye alignment. Designed for personal use, quick prototyping, and private hosting.
